# Getting started with MindiÂ® simulation and PIC18-Q71 microcontrollers
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module on the PIC18-Q71 family devices using the Mindi simulation tool. **For more information about getting started with and using the MPLAB Mindi Analog Simulator please refer to the following resources:**

## Configuration: Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA)

The Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier is a configuration with run-time selectable positive gain.

### Mindi Simulation

Download and open the following **Mindi schematic [here](schematics/Non_inverting_PGA.wxsch)**.

Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source.

### Adjustment Options
The amplification of the Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier can be adjusted using any of 8 internal resistor ladder ratio levels by changing the GSEL value in the appropriate OPAxCON register. The table below shows the different gain settings in this mode of operation, and the corresponding GSEL values. This information can also be found in the device datasheet.

|GSEL[2:0]  | R1   | R2   | Non-Inverting (1 + R2/R1)|
|-----------|:----:|:----:|:------------------------:|
|111        | 1R   | 15R  |  16                      |
|110        | 2R   | 14R  |  8                       |
|101        | 4R   | 12R  |  4                       |
|100    	  | 6R   | 10R  |  8/3                     |
|011     	  | 8R   | 8R   |  1                       |
|010        | 12R  | 4R   |  4/3                     |
|001        | 14R  | 2R   |  8/7                     |
|000        | 15R  | 1R   |  16/15                   |

### Updating composer fields
Once the desired result has been verified with Mindi simulation, the corrected values should be moved back into MCC by copying resistor values across to the composer of your preference.

### Don't have Mindi?
You can download and install the [Mindi simulation tool](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-mindi), or use another SPICE simulator of your own preference. For use with different simulators, a plain spice model can be found in "Opamp_PIC18_Q71.txt" to replace the mindi-optimized ".lb" file.
